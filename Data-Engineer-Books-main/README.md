# Data-Engineer-Books
Here is a list of some excellent books in data engineering here, some of which inevitably crossover into the spheres of data science and analysis, amongst other disciplines.

1. **Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems**
    
    The Book provides a foundational overview of data engineering in a modern Big Data context. Many data tools, methods and processes are covered, detailing everything from collecting and storing data to cleaning and transforming data for use in a number of modern tools and platforms. This  book covers key topics such as data storage and warehousing, structures, distributed systems, batch and stream processing, encoding, replication, partitioning and much more
    
    A must read if you want to gain deep understanding on Distributed System Design.
